# Language Translator
## Description 
Practiced using JavaScript by creating 3 objects. Each object contained a list of words and its translation in a different language. A user could input one of the words or a phrase containing those words into the input box and click on one of three buttons labeled with the preferred language they would like to see the english word translated to. The word or phrase would then appear in an output container.
